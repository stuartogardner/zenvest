# zenvest

This is the readme file for the eFounders Zenvest project. 

It uses a MEVN stack (swapping out Angular for Vue.js).

If you clone this project, after you have npm installed the files, run $ node bin/seeds.js in the server file, to populate your DB. There are three separate deals, but these have been entered three times to make the db look as if it has more deal flow.
